# Unit Test Completion Rule

## MANDATORY PROCESS - TEST-FIRST DEVELOPMENT (TDD)

**Before any feature implementation begins:**

1. **Write Unit Tests FIRST**
   - Write comprehensive unit tests for the feature BEFORE implementation
   - Define expected behavior through tests
   - Cover all edge cases and error scenarios
   - Tests should initially FAIL (red phase)
   - No implementation code until tests are written

2. **Build Feature (Minimal Implementation)**
   - Implement ONLY the minimal code needed to make tests pass
   - Focus on making tests green, not perfect code
   - Ensure code compiles and runs
   - All unit tests must pass: `npm test`

3. **Refactor & Polish**
   - Improve code quality while keeping tests green
   - Add error handling and edge case support
   - Optimize performance if needed
   - Maintain test coverage throughout refactoring

4. **Human Validate**
   - Manual testing by human user
   - Verify feature works as expected in real usage
   - Test integration with existing workflow
   - Confirm acceptance criteria met
   
   **High-Level Validation Steps:**
   - Open browser to d:\pickle-frontend\sources\index.html
   - Test authentication flow (REF2024 or ADMIN123)
   - Load demo match (MATCH-001 or MATCH-002)
   - Test new feature functionality thoroughly
   - Verify UI displays correctly on tablet-sized viewport
   - Test touch interactions and button responses
   - Confirm feature integrates properly with existing workflow
   - Test error scenarios and edge cases
   - Validate acceptance criteria from user stories

5. **Update Documentation**
   - Update unit-test-plans.md (mark test cases as [x])
   - Update development-checklist.md (mark features as [x])
   - Update requirements.md (mark requirements as [x])
   - Update user-stories.md (mark acceptance criteria as [x])

## CRITICAL RULES

**TESTS MUST BE WRITTEN FIRST - NO EXCEPTIONS**
**No implementation code until comprehensive unit tests exist**
**Only after human validation AND successful unit tests can documentation be updated**

This TDD approach ensures:
- Clear feature requirements defined through tests
- Better code design driven by test requirements
- Higher code quality and reliability
- Comprehensive test coverage from day one
- Faster debugging and fewer bugs
- Feature actually works for users
- Accurate documentation
- Traceable progress
