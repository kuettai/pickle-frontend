### Game State Model
```javascript
gameState = {
  serving: {
    team: 'left|right',      // Serving team
    player: 1|2,             // Score display number
    activeServer: 1|2,       // Highlighted player
    side: 'left|right'       // Serving side
  },
  teams: {
    left|right: {
      score: 0-30,
      players: [
        { name: 'Player Name', position: 'top|bottom' }
