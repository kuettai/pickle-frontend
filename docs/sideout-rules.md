Sideout Key Scoring Rules:
- Only the serving team can score points. Points are scored only when the serving team wins a rally.
- The game is usually played to 11 points, but the winning team must have a two-point lead to win, so the game can extend beyond 11 if necessary.
- When the serving team loses a rally, they lose the serve (this is called a side-out), and the opposing team becomes the new serving team.
- In doubles, each team member serves twice per side-out before the service passes to the opposing team, except for the very first server of the game, who serves only once initially.
- The serve is made diagonally. The server serves from the right side court when their score is even and from the left side when their score is odd.
- The score is announced as server score, receiver score, and server number (which server is serving in doubles).
- Players switch sides of the court after each point won during their serve.
- The receiving team does not score points directly but gains the serve after a side-out.

Double Scoring example:
"Scenario","Description","Score Call Example","Notes"
"Game start serve","The player on the right (server #2) serves first, score is 0-0-2","""0-0-2""","Only server #2 serves first in the game"
"Serving team wins rally","Serving team scores a point, server switches sides (right to left or left to right)","""1-0-2""","Same server continues serving from new side"
"Server #2 loses rally (first serve)","Side-out, serve passes to opponent team, score remains the same but server changes","""0-0-1"" (opponent)","Opponent starts serving with their server #1"
"Server #1 loses rally (after server #2 fault)","Partner server #2 gets to serve next, score same","""1-0-2""","Partner gets second serve chance"
"Server #2 loses rally (second fault)","Side-out, opponents get serve, score stays same, server switches","""0-1-1"" (opponent)","Serve switches to opponent team"
"Serving team scores consecutive points","Each point scores increment server's score, server alternates sides after each point","""3-1-1"", ""4-1-1""","Server keeps serving until fault"
"Receiving team never scores but gains serve after side-out","No points awarded to receivers, only gain right to serve","N/A","Receiving team does not switch sides"
"Score call format","Always: ServingTeamScore - ReceivingTeamScore - ServerNumber","""5-3-2""","ServerNumber is 1 or 2 indicating which server serves"
