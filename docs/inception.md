# Pickleball Tournament Scoring System - Inception Document

## Project Vision
Create a tablet-based pickleball scoring system that enables referees to manage tournament matches with accurate sideout scoring, real-time updates, and seamless integration with tournament management systems.

## Problem Statement
Tournament organizers need a reliable, intuitive scoring system that:
- Handles complex pickleball sideout scoring rules accurately
- Works consistently across different tablet platforms
- Integrates with existing tournament management systems
- Reduces scoring errors and disputes during matches
- Provides clear visibility for players and spectators

## Success Criteria
- **Accuracy**: 100% correct implementation of sideout scoring rules
- **Usability**: Referees can operate system with minimal training
- **Reliability**: Zero scoring errors due to system malfunction
- **Performance**: Sub-second response time for all interactions
- **Compatibility**: Works on iPad, Samsung, and Windows tablets

## Key Stakeholders
- **Primary Users**: Tournament referees
- **Secondary Users**: Players, spectators, tournament directors
- **Technical**: Tournament management system providers
- **Business**: Tournament organizers, pickleball associations

## Core User Stories

### Epic 1: Match Authentication & Setup
- As a referee, I need to authenticate with a secure code to access the scoring system
- As a referee, I need to load preset match data using a UUID to ensure correct player assignments
- As a referee, I need to confirm player information before starting to prevent mix-ups

### Epic 2: Game Configuration
- As a referee, I need to assign teams to court sides during warm-up
- As a referee, I need to select which team serves first
- As a referee, I need the system to handle singles, doubles, and mixed doubles formats

### Epic 3: Live Scoring
- As a referee, I need to touch court sides to record rally outcomes
- As a referee, I need the system to automatically handle sideout rules and server rotation
- As a referee, I need clear visual indicators of current server and serving side

### Epic 4: Game Management
- As a referee, I need to correct scoring errors when they occur
- As a referee, I need the system to detect game completion (11+ points, 2-point lead)
- As a referee, I need to submit final scores to the tournament system

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript (Progressive Web App)
- **Platform**: Cross-platform tablet support
- **Orientation**: Horizontal landscape mode
- **Interface**: Touch-optimized court layout

### Backend Integration
- **API**: RESTful services for match data and scoring
- **Authentication**: Secure referee validation
- **Data Format**: JSON for match configuration and score updates

### Key Components
1. **Authentication Module**: Referee login and validation
2. **Match Loader**: UUID-based match data retrieval
3. **Court Display**: Visual pickleball court with touch zones
4. **Scoring Engine**: Sideout rule implementation
5. **Player Manager**: Name display and server tracking
6. **API Client**: External system integration

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Scoring Logic Complexity**: Sideout rules are intricate and error-prone
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Different tablet behaviors
- **Network Connectivity**: API dependency during matches

### Medium Risk
- **User Training**: Referee adoption and learning curve
- **Performance**: Touch responsiveness under tournament pressure

### Low Risk
- **UI Design**: Court layout is well-defined
- **Data Format**: Standard JSON API patterns

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must work offline for scoring (sync when connected)
- Horizontal orientation only
- Touch interface required
- Minimum tablet screen size: 10 inches

### Business Constraints
- Tournament integration required
- Referee authentication mandatory
- Real-time scoring updates needed

### Assumptions
- Referees have basic tablet operation skills
- Tournament systems provide standardized APIs
- Stable WiFi available at tournament venues
- Match data is pre-configured in tournament system

## Success Metrics
- **Adoption Rate**: 90% of referees successfully use system within 2 training sessions
- **Error Rate**: <1% scoring discrepancies per match
- **Performance**: <500ms response time for touch interactions
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime during tournament operations
- **Integration**: Successful data sync with 95% of tournament management systems
